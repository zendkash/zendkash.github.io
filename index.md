# Zendai Kashino

I am a graduate student in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. I am currently doing research in the [Computer Integrated Manufacturing Lab](https://cimlab.mie.utoronto.ca/) and [Autonomous Systems and Biomechatronics Lab](http://asblab.mie.utoronto.ca/) under the co-supervision of Prof. Beno Benhabib and Prof. Goldie Nejat. 

My current research focuses on [search planning in wilderness search and rescue missions](../research1).
