# Zendai Kashino

I am an AI/ML Engineer at [GHELIA INC.](https://ghelia.com/en/) and am involved in AI/ML related work.

Before that, I was an Assistant Professor at the [Information Somatics Lab](https://star.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) where I participated in research on human augmentation.

For my Ph.D., I conducted research in the [Computer Integrated Manufacturing Lab](https://cimlab.mie.utoronto.ca/) and [Autonomous Systems and Biomechatronics Lab](http://asblab.mie.utoronto.ca/) in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto under the co-supervision of Prof. Beno Benhabib and Prof. Goldie Nejat. 
My Ph.D. thesis focused on [search planning in wilderness search and rescue missions](../AutonomousWiSAR).

My research interests include but are not limited to: artificial intelligence, machine learning, optimization, operations research, probabilistic reasoning, computer vision, human-robot/human-computer interaction/integration, human augmentation, multi-agent systems, swarm robotics, augmented/virtual reality, search and rescue robotics, path planning, sensor networks.
